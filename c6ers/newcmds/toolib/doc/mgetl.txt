SUMMARY mgetl

#include <tools.h>

char *mgetl(pbuf, len, pSrc);
char *pbuf;
int len;
char *pSrc;

DESCRIPTION

mgetl gets the next line from the memory at pSrc.  CR and LF are removed
and line is terminated with '\0'.  len is the max number of characters
that may be stored into pbuf.  Returns NULL if *pSrc == NULL at entry else
returns pointer to next char in pSrc to be processed.

Tabs, \t, are replaced by appropriate number of blanks to reach the next
tab stop.  Tabs tops are at n*8 for n greater than or equal to zero.
