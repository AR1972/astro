DESCRIPTION

  
  	    If ( Buffer is empty )
  		Fill Buffer
  	    If ( 0 length request ) return ( there is more data )?
  	    { - 1 allows for '\0' byte in target }
  	    set max to min(max - 1, count of valid bytes);
  	    If ( "full line" is buffered )
  		Transfer Full line.
  		Clean up and go
  	    Move partial line to base of buffer
  	    Fill rest of buffer
  	    If ( we have a "full line" now ) transfer it
