#include <tools.h>

char *pname (char *pszName)

DESCRIPTION
  
  	OS/2 v1.2 and later will allow filenames to retain the case
  	when created while still being case insensitive for all operations.
  	This allows the user to create more visually appealing file names.
  
  	All runtime routines should, therefore, preserve the case that was
  	input.	Since the user may not have input in the case that the entries
  	were created, we provide a service whereby a pathname is adjusted
  	to be more visually appealing.	The rules are:
  
  	if (real mode)
  	    lowercase the sucker
  	else
  	if (version is <= 1.1)
  	    lowercase the sucker
  	else
  	if (filesystem is FAT)
  	    lowercase the sucker
  	else
  	    for each component starting at the root, use DosFindFirst
  		to retrieve the original case of the name.
