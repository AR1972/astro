int Connect (path, con, sub)
char *path;
char *con;
char *sub;

flagType fDisconnect (drive)
int drive;

DESCRIPTION

Connect takes a name in the form \\mach\path and attempts to connect to
the named machine.	Since DOS 3.x has problems with connections, we
attach the connection to a drive.

fDisconnect will delete a connection to a particular drive given
the token returned by Connect.

RETURN VALUE

Connect returns -1 if connection was not successful, otherwise
returns drive token.

fDisconnect returns TRUE if disconnection was successful

IMPLEMENTATION

path	network name of the form 
	    \\machine\path  -or- 
	    \\machine\shortname\path
con 	buffer to place the successful connection
sub 	buffer to place the remainder of the path
