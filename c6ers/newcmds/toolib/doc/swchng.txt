DESCRIPTION

   Searchs the file strSwFile for
       [strTag]
           LHS=
 
   and if strRHS is non-empty changes the right hand side to strRHS
   else deletes the line LHS=
 
   swchnglhs: The original file is fdeleted for recovery via UNDEL.
   swchng   : if fNoUndel, then original file is deleted, no UNDEL possible
              else fdeleted for recovery via UNDEL.
 
   LHS=RHS is output right after the start of section and any later
   instances of LHS are removed.  N.B. if RHS is "", no LHS= is output
 
   If section doesn't exist in file, it is appended at end

IMPLEMENTATION

SEE ALSO   

NOTE
    swchng used to delete the .ini file if there was no space available.
    This error status is returned by swchange in the pfError parameter,
    and no change is made if the necessary disk space is not available.
