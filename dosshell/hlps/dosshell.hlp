!I102!@
Adding Program Items to Program Groups

In the program list, you can add a program item to a group. A program item contains startup information about a program file. When you choose the program item, MS-DOS Shell starts the program according to your instructions.

NOTE: A program item is not the program file itself. If you add a progam item, you add only the program list's startup instructions for that program. The program itself remains in its directory on your hard drive.

To add a program item:

1. Open the group you want to add a new item to.
2. From the File menu, choose New.
   The New Program Object dialog box appears.
3. Select the Program Group option button and choose the OK button.
   The Add Program dialog box appears.
4. Type a name for the program item (up to 23 characters).
5. In the Commands box, type the name of the program file
   that runs the program, along with any additional switches
   or parameters.
6. If you want, specify a startup directory,
   application shortcut key, password, or advanced
   properties for this item.
7. Choose the OK button.


To specify a shortcut key combination in the Application Shortcut Key box:

1. Select the Application Shortcut Key box.
2. Press one of the following keys: SHIFT, CTRL, or ALT. Then
   type a letter.
   MS-DOS Shell displays the keys you pressed. If [none]
   appears in the text box, the shortcut key combination you
   entered is unavailable. Try another combination.

For example, if you want to use SHIFT+W to move to Microsoft Word, you would press SHIFT and then type w. MS-DOS would display SHIFT+W in the text box and next to the
program title in the Active Task List.

NOTE: Some key combinations are not available. Do not use the following key combinations:

CTRL+M
CTRL+I
CTRL+H
CTRL+[
CTRL+5 (on the keypad)
SHIFT+CTRL+M
SHIFT+CTRL+I
SHIFT+CTRL+H
SHIFT+CTRL+[

8. Choose the OK button.


To specify a shortcut key combination in the Application Shortcut Key box:

Associating Files with a Program

Any file in the file list can be linked with a program so that opening the file automatically starts the program. Files are associated using their filename extensions. For example, you could link files that have the .TXT extension with the MS-DOS Editor program so that when you open a .TXT file, MS-DOS Editor automatically starts and opens that file.

To associate a file with a program:

1. Select the program file that you want to associate
   files with.
2. From the File menu, choose Associate.
   The Associate dialog box appears.
3. Type the extensions of the files that you want to
   associate with the program, separating each
   extension with a space.
4. Choose the OK button.

Or

1. Select a file that has the extension you want.
2. From the File menu, choose Associate.
   The Associate dialog box appears.
3. Type the path and program filename of the program you
   want to associate with that extension.
4. Choose the OK button.

NOTE: You can associate up to 20 different file extensions with one program. However, you can only associate an extension with one program at a time. For example, you can't associate the extension .TXT with two different text-editing programs at the same time.

Once you delete a file, you might not be able to recover it. You can recover deleted files with certainty only if no other files have been created or changed on the disk.

Avoid running any programs or using any commands other than the run and undelete commands at the command prompt until you restore the file you deleted.

Generally, the undelete command is the best way to restore files, because it creates fewer temporary files which might overwrite the deleted files you are trying to restore.

There are several ways to restore files you deleted. If you have any programs running in the Active Task List, you can:
  * -Use the undelete command in the Run dialog box in MS-DOS Shell.
  * If the program has a way to get to the command prompt
    without writing to the disk, use it to use the undelete
    command. See the software documentation for more
    information.

CAUTION:If the disk you deleted files from is full, you may have trouble recovering deleted files. See "???" in the User's Guide and Reference for more information.

The MS-DOS Shell Window

When you first start MS-DOS Shell you see a window with a list of the files on the current drive and a list of programs available to you. For more information about these lists, see "File List and Program List."

The parts of the MS-DOS Shell window include the following:

  * The title bar displays the name MS-DOS Shell at
    the top of your screen.
     +--------------------------------------------+
     |                 MS-DOS SHELL               |

  * The menu bar lists the names of the available
    menus. When you select a menu, it displays a list
    of commands you can choose from.

    ---------------------------------------------
      File  Options  View  Tree  Help
    ---------------------------------------------

  * Drive letters indicate which drives are currently
    available.

  * The window title is the name of the current directory,
    group of files, group of program items, or the Active
    Task List.

  * The selection cursor shows you where you are in the
    list.

  * Scroll bars let you move part of a list into view
    when the whole list isn't visible at once.

  * The status bar, the bottom line on the screen, displays
    messages, and the current time.

Scroll Bars

Some areas of the MS-DOS Shell window and dialog boxes contain scroll bars you can use to view text that requires more than the available space.

To scroll           Do this
---------           -------
Line by line        Click one of the scroll arrows.
                    Or, press the UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW key.

Continuously        Point to one of the scroll arrows
                    and hold down the mouse button
                    until the information you want
                    comes into view. Or, hold down
                    the UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW key.

Quickly             Drag the scroll box up or down the
                    scroll bar to the position you
                    want. The section of the text or
                    list that comes into view depends
                    on the position of the scroll box.
                    For example, if you move the scroll
                    box halfway down the scroll bar,
                    the text halfway through a file
                    or list appears. You can also press the
                    PAGE DOWN or PAGE UP key.

!S103!@
Menus and Menu Commands

Commands represent actions that you can tell MS-DOS Shell to carry out. MS-DOS Shell lists commands in menus. The menus vary depending on whether the selected MS-DOS Shell window  is displaying directories and files or groups and program items.

SELECTING MENUS
Selecting the menu is the first step in choosing a command. You can also select a menu to:

  * See its commands.
  * Get Help on the selected menu by pressing the F1 key.

When you want to close a menu without choosing a command, press ESC.

CHOOSING COMMANDS
Some commands perform tasks directly; others require more information. No matter which menu or command you want to use, you follow the same procedure: first select the menu and then choose the command.

Some command names have symbols and letters next to them and sometimes command names are dimmed.

When you see this    It means
-----------------    --------
Dimmed command       The command is not available at
                     this time. You might need to select
                     something before you can use the
                     command, or it might not be avail-
                     able for the task you are currently
                     performing.

Diamond mark         The command is active. Used for
                     a command that turns a feature either
                     on or off.

Instead of remembering the exact parameters and other information needed to carry out commands from the command-line, you can fill out dialog boxes which display all the options. There are several ways to specify information in dialog boxes.

The following are the types of options you will see:

With this            You can
---------            -------
Check box            Select as many of the boxes as you
		     like. A selected check box contains
		     an X.

List box             Select one from the list of choices.
		     You can use the scroll bars to see
		     choices that aren't visible.

Option button        Select one from the group of small
		     round buttons. You can only select
		     one option at a time. The selected
		     option button contains a dot.

Text box             Type text in a box with a cursor in it.

After you supply the information, you choose the OK button to carry out the command.

To close a dialog box without carrying out the command, press ESC or choose the Cancel button.

You can also get Help on the dialog box by choosing the Help button.

File List and Program List

MS-DOS Shell provides two basic kinds of lists:

  * A list of directories and files
  * A list of program items and groups

MS-DOS Shell also offers you several ways to view these lists by using commands on the View menu, as follows:

To view                  Choose

File List Overview

The file list provides a convenient way to display and work with your disk drives, directories, and files. The file list displays a list of directories (called a directory tree) for a selected disk drive, and a list of files for a selected directory. Select a different disk drive to view its directory tree; select a different directory to view its files.

The menus at the top of the file list window contain commands you use when working with disks, directories, and files.

The following topics teach you the basics of using file list.

Disk Drives

When you start MS-DOS Shell, the file list displays the directories and files on the disk that contains the command files for MS-DOS Shell. To work with other directories and files, you need to select another drive. If there are several directories on the new drive, MS-DOS Shell displays a "Reading Disk Information" message.

Related Procedure

!S117!@
Directories

SELECTING DIRECTORIES
The current directory is the selected directory in the directory tree. You can select only one directory at a time.

EXPANDING DIRECTORIES
When you start MS-DOS Shell, the directory tree displays only the first level of directories on the current drive.

A plus sign (+) to the left of a directory name indicates that one or more subdirectories exists for that directory. If you select a directory icon that includes a plus sign, MS-DOS displays its subdirectories. This is called "expanding" the directory. When you expand a directory, the plus sign changes to a minus sign (-).

You can also use the commands on the Tree menu to control the amount of directory information displayed.

You can expand an entire branch (all subdirectories in the selected directory), a single level of the branch, or all directories in the tree.

COLLAPSING DIRECTORIES
You can "collapse" the directory to hide any currently displayed subdirectories. The minus sign (-) changes to a plus sign (+). When you start MS-DOS Shell, it displays the directories in the root directory.

File Selection

Before you can work with a file in the file list, you must select it. MS-DOS Shell indicates that a file is selected by highlighting its name in the list.

Within a directory, you can select more than one file at a time. This is called extending the selection. For example, you can select several files and copy them to another directory. You can select files that are:

  * In consecutive order
  * Scattered throughout the directory

You can always cancel a selection or all selections.

File Information

You can control how MS-DOS Shell displays information about files by using the File Display Options command on the Options menu. When you start MS-DOS Shell, the file list displays all the files in the current directory except hidden and system files. The files are listed alphabetically by name from A to Z. You can do the following:

  * Change the type of file displayed; for example, you
    can display only files that end with .TXT.

  * Display hidden and system files.

  * Sort alphabetically by filename or by extension,
    by date, by size, and by the order the files are
    placed on the disk.

  * Reverse the alphabetical or numerical order that MS-DOS Shell
    uses to sort by filename and extension or by date.

Program List Overview

The program list provides a convenient way to display and group program items so they're easy to locate and start. The list that MS-DOS Shell displays when you first use the program list is called the "Main group." The program list also comes with a group called "Disk Utilities" that contains an assortment of program items that run MS-DOS utilities.

The menus at the top of the program list window contain commands for working with program items and groups.
You can add, delete, organize, and modify groups and programs in the list by using commands on the File menu.

Program Groups and Program Items

A "group" is a name given to a collection of program items. Groups can also contain other program groups.

A "program item" contains startup instructions for a program. It's not the program file.

Groups can be distinguished from program items by either a different icon (to the left of the group name in graphics mode) or by brackets (surrounding the group name in text mode).

How to Start Programs

MS-DOS Shell offers several ways to start a program:

* From the file list
  Choose a program file or a file associated with it.
  Program filenames have .COM, .EXE, and .BAT extensions.
  When you quit the program you will return to MS-DOS Shell.

* With the Run Command
  From the File menu, choose Run. Unless the program file
  is in the path, you need to know the exact directory
  location and name of the program file before you can start
  the program. When you quit the program you will return to
  MS-DOS Shell.

* From a program item in the program list
  Choose a program item from a group. This is the most
  efficient way to start programs you use frequently and is
  especially useful for starting programs from different 
  directory locations. If the program item is not already in
  the program list, you must add it. When you quit the
  program you will return to MS-DOS Shell.

* From MS-DOS Command Prompt in the Main group
  Choosing MS-DOS Command Prompt exits MS-DOS Shell and
  displays the command prompt. You type the name of the
  program file and any parameters and switches on the
  command line, and then press ENTER. When you quit the
  program you will return to the command line. You must
  then type EXIT to return to MS-DOS Shell.

If you                             Start it by using

How to Use More than One Program

You can start several programs and move from one to another. For example, you can go from your database program to your spreadsheet, and then to your text editor, without having to quit one program and start another.

When you choose the Enable Task Swapper command, each program you start is added to the Active Task List. 

You use the Active Task List to move from one program to another.

When you quit a program, it is deleted from the Active Task List.

Caution: You should not run 3270 emulator programs with Task Swapper. Using them with Task Swapper may disconnect you from your mainframe and cause data to be lost.

--@@

!S123!@
Associated Files

If you have a set of files that you often use with a particular program, you can save time by associating files with the program. Then, when you choose the file, the program starts and automatically loads the file.

For example, you could associate all .TXT files with your text editor. Then, whenever you opened any .TXT file, MS-DOS Shell would automatically start your text editor and load the .TXT file.

You can associate up to 20 different file extensions with one program. However, you can only associate an extension with one program at a time. For example, you can't associate the extension .TXT with two different text editors at the same time.

You can also cancel the association between a file and a program.

There may be times when you need to use an already associated file with a different program. You can use the Run command to do this.
