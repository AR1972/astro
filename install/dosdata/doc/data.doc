This document gives the format for data files required for the
retail upgrade installation program.  

Basically, the data for each DOS-version has a one line header, giving
the Oem name and version number, followed by a number of classes of
information. Each class consists of the class name, in brackets, on a
single line, followed by a number of lines of textual information
that depend on the particulars of each class.  Not all classes need
be used for any given DOS.  The classes are:

[lie-to]	Lists existing programs that require addition
		to the lie version table.

[rename]	Lists on pairs of lines DOS programs that should
		be installed with new names.

[delete]	Lists programs which should be deleted from the
		target directory.  This includes existing utilities
		with different extensions from the current version.

[device]	Lists device drivers which need to be installed
		in the target drive and added to CONFIG.SYS.

[drivparm]	Lists drivparm commands which need to be added to
		CONFIG.SYS.

[rem-device]	Lists non-functional device drivers which need to
		be removed from CONFIG.SYS.  (E.g. disk cache 
		programs that no longer work properly.)

[no-install]	Lists any DOS 4.0 utilities that should not be
		installed on the new system.

[diff-file]    Lists the name of a non-standard file to be installed
		instead of the default file.

Blank lines are ignored.  Comments are introduced by a ";" and
terminated by the end of the line.  If more than one Oem-version of
DOS is being described in a file, the data for the various DOS's
needs to be separated by a line containing the end-of-data mark,
"###".  A typical example file might look like:

-----------------TOP-OF-FILE-------------------
COMPAQ 3.31

[lie-to]
display.sys
driver.sys
mode.com
basic.com
basica.com
basica.exe

setclock.com

[rename]

ZENITH 3.30

[bios]
zenith.bio

[lie-to]
fdisk.exe

[rename]
fdisk.exe
fdisk40.exe
--------------------END-OF-FILE-----------------

Needless to say, it is important to maintain consistency throughout
the numerous data files.  The exact same string should always be used
when refering to the same OEM.  Similarly, the file names listed
should all be given in lower case.
