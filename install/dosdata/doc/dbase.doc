This document gives the format for data files required for the
retail upgrade installation program.  

Basically, the data for each DOS-version has a one line header, giving
the Oem name and version number, followed by a number of classes of
information. Each class consists of the class name, in brackets, on a
single line, followed by a number of lines of textual information
that depend on the particulars of each class.  Not all classes need
be used for any given DOS.  The classes are:


[lie-to]	Lists existing programs that require addition
		to the lie version table.

[rename]	Lists on pairs of lines DOS programs that should
		be installed with new names.

[delete]	Lists programs which should be deleted from the
		target directory.  This includes existing utilities
		with different extensions from the current version.

[device]	Lists device drivers which need to be installed
		in the target drive and added to CONFIG.SYS.

[drivparm]	Lists drivparm commands which need to be added to
		CONFIG.SYS.

[rem-device]	Lists non-functional device drivers which need to
		be removed from CONFIG.SYS.  (E.g. disk cache 
		programs that no longer work properly.)

[no-install]	Lists any DOS 4.0 utilities that should not be
		installed on the new system.

[diff-file]	Lists the name of a non-standard file to be installed
		instead of the default file.

[upd-device]	Update the "DEVICE=" line in the config.sys file
		for the specified device name to prefix the path
		to the new DOS directory.


Blank lines are ignored.  Comments are introduced by a ";" and
terminated by the end of the line.  If more than one Oem-version of
DOS is being described in a file, the data for the various DOS's
needs to be separated by a line containing the end-of-data mark,
"###".  A typical example file might look like:

-----------------TOP-OF-FILE-------------------
COMPAQ 3.31

[lie-to]
display.sys
driver.sys
mode.com
basic.com
basica.com
basica.exe
clock.sys
enhdisk.sys
setclock.com

[rename]
display.sys
disply40.sys

driver.sys
driver40.sys

mode.com
mode40.com

ansi.sys
ansi40.sys

fdisk.com
fdisk40.com

keyb.com
keyb40.com

keyboard.sys
keybrd40.sys
###

ZENITH 3.30

[bios]
zenith.bio

[lie-to]
fdisk.exe

[rename]
fdisk.exe
fdisk40.exe
--------------------END-OF-FILE-----------------

Needless to say, it is important to maintain consistency throughout
the numerous data files.  The exact same string should always be used
when refering to the same OEM.  Similarly, the file names listed
should all be given in lower case.





/* DOSDATA -
		Program to maintain the data file for the retail upgrade install
		utility.  Usage is as follows:

		DOSDATA filename
			Incorporates the information from the specified text information
			file into the master data file.

		DOSDATA /D oemname version
			Deletes all information for the specified version of DOS
			from the master data file.


		An typical text information file might contain:

			Compaq 3.31
			lie:
			mode.com
			fdisk.exe
			rename:
			mode.com mode40.com
			fdisk.exe fdisk40.exe
			delete:
			print.exe

		The master data file has the format:

			Dos_record_1
			Dos_record_2
			...
			Dos_record_n
			Null_dos_record
			Name_record_1
			Name_record_2
			...
			Name_record_n
			Null_name_record
			Name_entry_1
			Name_entry_2
			...

		A Dos_record is:

			[oem-name][dos-version][data-addr]
			    18          2           4       = 24 bytes

			(The data-addr field is a pointer to the beginning of the
			various data tables for that DOS.)

		A Name_record is a variable length record containing a
			zero-terminated string with a file name or action name.

		A Name_entry is a 1 byte record containing an integer index into
			the name record table.


	Base name types
		n		number (as in minor/major version number)
		file	file
		ddr	Dos descriptor record
		ne		Name entry (index into array of names (isz))
