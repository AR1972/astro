The stupid guys had sp = 0 even though they<br>
were allocating a stack segment. How did it<br>
work for so long?

The pourpose of this project is to reconstruct the missing bits of the source<br>
tree and get this tree to build. Most of the important bit compile, but the<br>
strings will need to be copy/paste from MS-DOS 6.0 compiled binaries, some<br>
important defines are missing and a few libaries are missing and will have<br>
to be rewritten from scratch.
