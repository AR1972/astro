	TITLE	GRTABHAN - INTERRUPT HANDLER FOR INT 2FH, GRAFTABL LOADED
;****************** START OF SPECIFICATIONS *****************************
; MODULE NAME: GRTABHAN.SAL

; DESCRIPTIVE NAME: For GRAFTABL, this is the Multiplexor Interrupt Handler

;FUNCTION: This module contains the Interrupt Handler that will be hooked
;	    into the INT 2FH vector.  When invoked with AL=0, it responds
;	    that GRAFTABL is loaded by changing AL to contain hex FF.  If
;	    option AL=1 specified, it puts into the vector at DS:[BX] the
;	    pointer to the previously loaded table.

; NOTES:
;	 This module should be processed with the SALUT preprocessor:

;		SALUT GRTABHAN

;	 To assemble these modules, the alphabetical or sequential
;	 ordering of segments may be used.

;	 For LINK instructions, refer to the PROLOG of the main module,
;	 GRTAB.SAL.  This module, containing a resident interrupt handler,
;	 should be first in the list of .OBJ to be linked.

;	 At the time this handler code is made resident, the loader, GRTAB,
;	 made certain instruction modifications.  PATCH_OFF and PATCH_SEG
;	 are the immediate word fields of two move word immediate to
;	 storage type of instructions.	The loaded Revised these to
;	 contain the offset and the segid respectively of where the
;	 resident font table would be that is to stay resident.

;	 Also at load time, GRTAB made another instruction modification by
;	 changing the JUMP DUMMY instruction's DWORD immediate field to
;	 contain the vector pointing to the previous owner of the
;	 Multiplexor Interrupt Vector.

; ENTRY POINT: There are two entry points: one, from DOS at 100H, is
;	    END_PSP.  The jump instruction there has nothing to do with
;	    the interrupt handler, but merely jumps to the GRTAB module to
;	    what is effectively the real DOS entry point, ENTRY_POINT.

;	    The other is where the interrupt vector will be set to point,
;	    the entry point to the interrupt handler code:  HANDLER.

;	    For the rest of this module description, the HANDLER entry
;	    point conditions are being described.

; INPUT: AH = Multiplexor Number.  I do nothing if this is not my own.
;	      The value of the Multiplexor Number is defined in the EQU:
;	      MY_MULTIPLEXOR_NUMBER as being the value, B0H.
;	 AL = Function Request.  There are two functions recognized:
;		    0 = "GET INSTALLED STATE"
;		    1 = "WHERE ARE YOU?"
;			 and DS:BX points to vector to receive pointer
;			 to the previously installed GRAFTABL table.
;		    If Function request is not '1', it is assumed to be '0'.

; EXIT-NORMAL: If the proper multiplexor number is presented, respond with
;	       AH = 0FFH, otherwise, pass control to previous owner
;	       of this interrupt.

; EXIT-ERROR: None

; INTERNAL REFERENCES:
;    ROUTINES: none

;    DATA AREAS:
;	   PUBLIC symbols:
;	 PREV_OWN      Far jump direct to previous owner of interrupt 2FH.
;	 PATCH_OFF     Offset portion of vector pointing to loaded char cable.
;	 PATCH_SEG     Segment portion of vector pointing to loaded char table.
;	 HANDLER       Entry point pointed to by the vector at interrupt 2FH.
;	 HANDLER_SIZE  Location of the end of the resident code portion of the
;		   interrupt 2FH handler, including the 60H bytes left of
;		   the PSP, so this offset is relative to the start of the PSP
;		   after the code has been relocated downward into the PSP.
;	 MPEXNUM       The byte containing the value defined
;		   as being the id checked for when INT 2FH is called used
;		   to identify this GRAFTABL member of the multiplexor chain.
