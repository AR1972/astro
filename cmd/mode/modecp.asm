;  --------  ---  ---  ------------------------------------------------------
;  05/22/90  MKS  C05  MODE was hanging when preparing code pages.  This is
;                      because someone was using PSP:6 to see how many free
;                      bytes were in the segment.  This old CALL5 from CPM is
;                      not officially supported and apparently changed in 5.0.
;                      We are now doing basically the same thing, but using a
;                      DOS call to see how much memory is left in the segment.
