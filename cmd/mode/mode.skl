;  AN001 - P3976: Need to have all pieces of messages in MODE.SKL so have to
;		  implement the SYSGETMSG method of getting addressability to
;		  the pieces.  This means that the code does a SYSGETMSG call
;		  which returns a pointer (DS:SI) to the message piece.  The
;		  address is then put in the sublist block for the message
;		  being issued.
