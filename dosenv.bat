rem SYNTAX: dosenv [drive:]
rem where "drive" is the drive the build tree resides in.

rem  This batch file sets up the environment for building DOS.
rem  Note that running this more than once per session will result in
rem  compounded growth of the path and probably related errors.
rem                     ****CAUTION*****
rem      Build problems will occur if you use more environment variables
rem      then are set below. The build will stop in the BOOT directory
rem      and nosrvbld.exe gives a "Null Pointer" error. If this happens
rem      reboot and use only this environment. Adding more environment
rem      space from command.com does not fix it.
