; This file is read by the tool makemsgs, which produces the files:
;      qbimsgs.asm, qbimsgs.inc, and qbimsgs.h
;
; Entries in this file have the form:

;Section 1:  Runtime Errors - symbol names are kept small to decrease
;            the size of the runtime library.
;            Names begin with ER_ to distinguish them from non-runtime
;            errors, which begin with MSG_.
