;rtmint.inc - 09/03/87 - runtime module communications interrupts
;***
;
;	Copyright <C> 1986, Microsoft Corporation
;
;Purpose:
; This file is defines the runtime module communications interrupts. Any entry
; exists in this file for each runtime entry point that can be called by
; compiled code.
;
; This file is used in two places. It is included in rtmint.asm to create a
; module which compiled programs FAR CALL into to get dispatched to the runtime
; module. It is also included in rtm86.asm (or an interpeter equivalent) to
; dispatch to the intended routines.
;
; The reason this file exists is so that the interrupt number assignments are
; more or less version independent (at the expense of a big maintenence
; hassle.) Also, there are very few conditionals because the generic and full
; versions of the runtime module should be interchangable (same full set of
; interrupts).
;
;[9] The file number parameter was added to add granularity to non /o programs.
;[9] Entry points are grouped together with those that are likely to be
;[9] used along with each other.
;[9] This grouping is approximate and may be changed at any time.
;[9]
;[9] The following system is now being used:
;[9]	File 1:	Those functions required for a minimal "END" program
;[9]	File 2:	B$SRUN.  This is the only function that uses __doexec,
;[9]		which must be kept in the RTM LIBRARY.  __doexec is only
;[9]		linked in if a program contains a RUN statement.
;[9]	File 3:	"Common" entry points
;[9]	File 4:	"Non-common" floating point entry points
;[9]	File 5:	"graphics" entry points
;[9]	File 6:	everything else (includes unused C startup entries)
;[9]
;
;Summary of fields:
;
;	RTMENT	entryname,file,entryseg,startlabel,callflag,switches
;
;	    entryname - Name of routine
;	    file      - which file (RTMINT<file>.ASM) has the definition
;	    entryseg  - segment of <entryname> if not ???
;	    startlabel- Alternate name for routine
;	    callflag  - Blank: Function will ONLY be CALLed FAR.
;			'0'    Function can be JMP'ed to.  Will return.
;			'1'    Function can be JMP'ed to.  Will not return.
;	    switches  - set of MASM switches.  If defined and FALSE, there
;			will be no support for this routine, though the
;			postbyte will still be allocated.
;
;	NOTE: This is a SHARED INCLUDE FILE, used by both the RUNTIME and
;	NOTE: the interpreter projects.  Any changes made to one should
;	NOTE: be carried over (COPIED) to the other!!!

; Entry points referenced by intepreter executors. (Must all be single post-
