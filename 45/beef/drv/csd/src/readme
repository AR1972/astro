	Installable Screen Drivers:

 ibmtext.csd	is a basic installable screen driver supporting
		7 screen modes under DOS3.

 fx_csd3.obj	is the fixed version of ibmtext.csd

 fx_twin.obj	is a fixed version of ibmtext.csd with the video
		save routines.

 vio.csd	is the basic OS/2 version.
 fx_csd5.obj	is the basic fixed OS/2 version.
