    This document lists the features of VAPs which have been implemented in
the present version: 0.5 (Oct 7,'88).

    At present, the application has all the commands in section 7 at its
disposal except for FSaveVapInfo and FLoadVapInfo.  Communication with VAPs
and installation of individual VAPs are supported.

    Generally, as far as the Notification and Request messages are concerned,
all messages are supported except those to do with menus, keys, or the Works
messages near the end.  Supported messages are:

	VN_			VR_

	Initialize		Beep
	Terminate		TmcDoDlg
	Idle			MessageBox
	Command			RePaint
				TextOut

	dialog Procs		TMC routines
	control Procs		MemAlloc/MemRealloc/MemFree/MemLock/MemUnlock

Command, at present, is only supported through direct application calls.

    No menu hooks or hot keys are supported.

    For edit Procs, there is one major limitation: only single word values can
be handled.  This means that in any dialog, all CAB arguments must be words;
no handles or fixed length allowed.  If more than a word is needed, the edit
Proc must handle its own memory, and store a handle or a pointer in the word
given.  The word can be accessed as normal, bArg offset into the block
represented by hobj, as long as no assumptions are made about anything other
than that word being valid.  Also, the tmmCwVal call should always return 1.
Edit Procs also cannot cause any other edit Procs to be called; they cannot
be recursive, since only a small buffer is allocated for edit Procs.
