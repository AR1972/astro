The following file is called CBOXDIST.TXT (checked into LIB\CW\DOC).

CBOX Distribution for Multiplan 4.x:
====================================

All builds are made from FAVOG.

Favog has distribution directory enlisted, build is made from DOS machine
(all .OBJs and original sources remain on FAVOG).
Special dedicated CBOX and DRV directories for Plan have been created.
The Sbmgr, Interpreter and Mathpack are from standard distributions (since
they do not change significantly) -- and the resulting .LIB files checked
into the CW\LIB directory.

The Plan distribution directories will get out of sync, but will represent
the time that the Plan build was made.

The distribution root is /u/eu/dist on favog, or \\favog\slm\dist

CW + final CBOX build:

	lib/cbox/plan40/dcbox/cw

Distribution steps:
1) check everything in
2) log in to favog
3) ssync the /u/eu/dist/lib/cbox/plan40/dcbox/cw directory ("ssync -vrf")
	(this may be a selective "ssync" if only specific changes are to
	be changed in the build).
4) connect to FAVOG\SLM from DOS machine
5) go to build directory (\DIST\LIB\CBOX\PLAN40\DCBOX\CW).
6) run the "make_all" batch file.
7) run the update batch file UPDCBOX.BAT (in \LIB\CW\CBOX on your machine,
	updcbox uses P: and V: so don't start it from these drives).

All distributed files are copied to \\PSTOOLS\DIST\CBOX.

========== ========== ==========

Yet to be added to the standard distribution are:

standard libraries: SBMGR/MATH/LMEM/INTER.
CW drivers.
